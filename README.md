What is it? <br>
Purrfect-Clips-v0.1 is a game in early development stage that I am making so I can get better at C++.

Dependancies: <br>
It uses RayLib and the whole thing is compiled with MSVC since I am using Visual Studio as my IDE.

RayLib: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib <br>
Instructions how to easily get RayLib working on Visual Studio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiZGTIYld1M
